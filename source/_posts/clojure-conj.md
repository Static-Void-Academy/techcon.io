Clojure is a functional, Lisp dialect built to run on top of existing frameworks. Currently, it can compile to Java bytecode, [CLR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr), or emit JavaScript. High performance data structures and powerful concurrency primitives make Clojure a growing language in the software community.
